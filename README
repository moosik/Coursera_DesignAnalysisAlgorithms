This repository contains the hw solutions for the Design and Analysis of Algorithms Part
1 class with Tim Roughgarden (Coursera). All homework assignments were written
in R (poor choice of language). Currently it doesn't have hw4 because the code
produced 'by 1 error' and was also very slow (it took about 10 days to get an
answer).

The other hw solutions are correct.
